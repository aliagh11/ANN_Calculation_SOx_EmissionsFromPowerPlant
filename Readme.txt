In this C# code I calculated the output of ANN for predicting the SOx emissions from Qom Power Plant. 
Already in this project we used ANN and Deep Learnin methods to predicting the SOx emissions and by using
the results of ANN for weights and bias in this code I calculated the output of the ANN manually in C#.

In this code firstly we are going to normalize data and then we used sigmoid function as an activation function 
then we used weights and bias of the ANN for calculating the SOx emissions.
